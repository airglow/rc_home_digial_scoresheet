# RoboCup @Home Digital Score Sheet

This is an initial thought of how to assist during the scoring of the RoboCup@Home
tasks. It parses the score sheet tex files and interprets the macros used for scoring.
In the end it generates a report as txt.

Usage like:

`./digital_score_sheet.py <ScoreSheetTexFile> <TeamName>`

where `<ScoreSheetTexFile>` is the path to the corresponding score sheet of a task and
`TeamName` is the team's name.

Suggestions are welcome.
